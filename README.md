Determining or predicting churn rate is key in increasing business effectiveness and allowing for targeted marketing and resources to increase customer retention. This is especially the case for a bank who released their user data on Kaggle for assistance on predicting churn in order to reduce it. The goal then of this project is to provide a churn prediction model to mitigate the bank’s churn rate and increase overall bank revenue by 20% for the next financial quarter.
