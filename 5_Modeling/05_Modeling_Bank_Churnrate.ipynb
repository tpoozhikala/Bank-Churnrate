And it seems that overall precision for the 'dropped' dataset seemed to be better than the missing. This might be again due to size of the respective datasets as the 'dropped' being smaller might lead to having a larger prediction score than just imputing the null values as 'missing.' Again the accuracy for the 'dropped' dataset is slighltly higher than the 'missing' dataset for potentially the same reason of having less data to predict."

And feature values with moderate negative correlation with Attrition_Flag column are namely Contacts_Count_12_mon and Months_Inactive_12_mon. Again there seems to be an intuitive sense to this, as based on the customers pattern of use, seems to correlate with whether or not the customer will attrite. Howevever, it seems that how many dependents a customer had or their relationship count, also had some affect on the variance for the Attrition_Flag column. These features will be kept in mind when in development of future steps for an appropraite predictive model. \n",
